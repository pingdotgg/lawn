# lawn

Video review platform for creative teams. Built by Theo.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

I am, effectively, not accepting PRs at this time. This may change in the future. My preferred "PR" method is to describe problems in the issues tab and give me detailed prompts I can quickly copy/paste into my agent of choice.

## ...why did you build this?

I got tired of Frame.io slowly regressing. I wanted something simple, fast and reliable.

I don't know how much time I'll have to maintain this long term, so I decided to open source it. I have no idea where this project is going long term.

My team is using lawn every day already. We intend to continue, and we intend to keep adding things we need throughout.
